# About this Course
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML markup language for creating two-dimensional images using vectors. This is different from traditional raster-based image formats that use pixels, like JPEG and PNG. When used on web pages, SVG images provide an infinite level of detail, so they look sharp regardless of screen size or pixel density. In this course, we'll look at situations where SVGs are better than PNG and JPEG files, as well as when an SVG might not be the best choice. Finally, we'll learn how to modify SVGs using CSS.

## What you'll learn
- Vector graphics versus raster graphics
- Image and background SVGs
